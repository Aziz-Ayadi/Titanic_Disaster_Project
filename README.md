# Titanic Disaster Project : Project Overview

* Created a machine learning project that tends to predict whether passengers of Titanic ship survived the disaster or not.
* Collected the data to work with from kaggle website (from a competition called 'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster') already divided in train and test sets.
* Cleaned data up and engineered features so they will help us in the prediction process like extracting title of every passenger from their names.
* Optimized Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Gaussian NB, Perceptron, Linear SVC, Stochastic Gradient descent, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to get the best training performance and the best estimator.
